This program will randomly place a set of ships of varying length around a 2D array "board" without overlapping eachother
The user can then shoot at ships to sink them if all of their spots have been hit. If a ship is sunk the console will display "You Sunk My {shipType}"
like You Sunk My Battleship! or Destroyer! and so on

for some reason some iterations will only partially build ships. making it impossible to actually win --- this is rare though
